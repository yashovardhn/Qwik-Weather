There are a variety of weather iOS apps in App Store. Those apps have great features and
functionalities to satisfy users. However, according to my research, only a few of them have
friendly user interface and human centred interactions, which means that a lot of them might be
difficult to be navigated even though they provide enough functionalities. It is not convenient
for new users.
Therefore, I would like to do improvements on weather iOS apps. The objectives include:
The iOS app allows people to check out the weather in multiple cities worldwide. The weather
data is dynamic, which means that users can see the weather anytime.
The iOS app not only show the weather, temperature and humidity, but it also uses various
icons to represent the weather accordingly. It will be easy to read and use.
Besides, the iOS app will have friendly user interfaces and human centred interactions. Users
can find the information they want in a short time and limited clicks. It is easy to be navigated
than other weather iOS apps in the market.
